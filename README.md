Iâ€™m a dedicated Flutter Developer with a strong command of Dart and a focus on building efficient, scalable, and responsive mobile applications. I specialize in developing clean and maintainable code, implementing smooth UI/UX from design tools like Figma, and integrating RESTful APIs with state management using GetX.

My role involves end-to-end mobile app development, from UI creation and API integration to performance optimization and feature deployment using clean architecture principles. I am experienced in using Firebase for authentication, real-time databases, and push notifications, and I regularly work with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Core Skills:
* Flutter & Dart
* GetX State Management
* Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Messaging)
* REST API Integration
* Clean Architecture & Code Structuring
* Git, GitHub, Postman, Android Studio, VS Code
* UI/UX implementation from Figma
