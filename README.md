# AI Engineer | LLMs & NLP | Vector Databases | MLOps & Cloud AI | AI Applications Architect
I am an AI Engineer specializing in designing, building, and deploying intelligent systems that bridge research and real-world applications. My expertise spans the full AI lifecycleâ€”from classical machine learning and deep learning to large language models, vector databases, and production-grade deployment.

I focus on developing scalable AI applications using transformers, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI agent frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph. With strong experience in MLOps, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud AI platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), I ensure that models transition seamlessly from prototype to production.

In addition to backend expertise, I integrate React and React Native frontends for complete end-to-end AI-driven products. I also emphasize performance optimization through quantization, pruning, and distillation to deliver efficient solutions.

Core Strengths:
* LLMs & NLP (Transformers, RAG, embeddings, fine-tuning)
* AI Infrastructure (LangChain, LangGraph, AI Agents, Vector Databases)
* MLOps & Cloud (Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, CI/CD, AWS/GCP/Azure AI)
* Deep Learning & ML (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn)
* AI System Design & Frontend Integration (React, React Native)

Always driven to push the boundaries of applied AI and transform ideas into scalable, real-world solutions.
